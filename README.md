# py4-dsms-success
> A repository for essentials for the DS MS program

Presented by Vanderbilt Data Science Institute data scientists:
* Dr. Jesse Spencer-Smith, Chief Data Scientist
* Dr. Charreau Bell, Senior Data Scientist
* Umang Chaudhry, Data Scientist

Prepared by:
* Dr. Charreau Bell, Senior Data Scientist

## Overview
The objective of these workshops is to develop foundational skills in basic Python and pandas to faciliate work in Python for data science. This workshop will cover Python basics, but mainly focus on providing a blend of intuitive understanding of the tools along with fundamental Python skills for success with a user-friendly Python API.

### Getting the Most out of this Course
To get the most out of this crash course in Python:
* Open Colab (workbook) notebooks and actively write code along with the instructor
* Actively participate in discussion
* Actively participate in breakout rooms
* Perform homework assignments before coming to class the next day
* Relax your mind and ask questions

## Asynchronous (Homework) Assignments
A number of examples will be left to the reader.  Please complete these assignments prior to coming to the next day of the course.  These homework assignments are designed to augment your understanding of Python, enable you to avoid common pitfalls of programming, resolve known areas of ambiguity that often arise in our new learners, and navigate and understand common errors that Python will throw.
